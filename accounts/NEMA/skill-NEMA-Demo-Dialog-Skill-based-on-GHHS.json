The States, not the Federal government, decide on the design of the program, the type and amount of assistance payments, the range of other services to be provided, and the rules for determining who is eligible for benefits.\n\n</br>See: <a href=\"https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/help\" target=\"_blank\">Help for Families</a>.\nTo locate the nearest State or Tribal TANF program office, select your state from the drop-down list."
